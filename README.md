🧮 Java RPN Scientific Calculator with Stack Operations
========================================================

> 🚀 A fully functional scientific calculator using Stack-Based Reverse Polish Notation, built in Java, designed with Waterfall methodology, and developed in a collaborative software engineering environment as part of a university project.

* * *

📌 Overview
-----------

**StackBasedCalculator** is a fully-featured **Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)** scientific calculator developed as part of a team project for a university Software Engineering course. Built with Java and the **Waterfall development model**, this project demonstrates modular architecture, collaborative coding, and extensive testing.

### 📁 Project Highlights

* ✅ RPN (postfix) input processing
    
* 🧠 Stack-based operations and memory
    
* 🎨 GUI interface with calculator-like appearance
    
* 🧪 JUnit test suite for core components
    
* 📊 UML & Gantt-based planning
    
* 📌 Developed in a simulated real-world environment
    

* * *

🌍 Language Note
----------------

All **code comments and internal documentation** are written in **Italian**, as the project was developed during a group exam at the **University of Salerno (Italy)**.

Despite this, the **codebase follows international best practices**, with clear method names and class structures that make it easily understandable for global developers and recruiters.

💡 Features
-----------

### 🔢 Stack Operations

* `clear` – remove all elements
    
* `drop` – remove top element
    
* `dup` – duplicate top element
    
* `swap` – swap top two elements
    
* `over` – duplicate second-to-top element
    

### ➕ Arithmetic & Variables

* Basic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
    
* 26 memory variables: `a` through `z`
    
    * `>x` – Load top of stack into variable `x`
        
    * `<x` – Push value from variable `x` onto the stack
        
    * `+x`, `-x` – Perform arithmetic with variable `x` and top of stack
        

### 🧮 Advanced Capabilities

* Complex number support
    
* Rich exception handling (stack underflow, invalid operations, etc.)
    
* GUI with custom calculator fonts
